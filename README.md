A deck of 100 cards - numbered 1,2,...,100 - is shuffled and then turned over one card at a time. We say that a “hit” occurs whenever card i is the i th card to be turned over, i = 1, . . . , 100. Simulate 10000 repetitions of the game to estimate the expectation and variance of the total number of hits.
